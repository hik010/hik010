### Hi. I'm Hyo! 👋

I am a <b>fullstack developer</b> and a recent graduate from University of California - San Diego with a degree in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics.

Having no option but to stay at home🏠 for the last 2 years of college, I started to play around with web development👩🏻‍💻 and created simple static websites. What first started as a curiosity eventually led me to this path of becoming a software engineer.       

📫 Feel free to reach out [here](mailto:hyo.kim0633@gmail.com)

⚡️ Fun fact: I'm trilingual and have lived in three different countries in my life. Born in 🇰🇷. Lived in 🇨🇳 for 10 years, and currently in California,🇺🇸
